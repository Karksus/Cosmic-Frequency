# R-tutorials

Some tutorials that I made during my PhD in Oncogenomics that I think may be useful to someone.

Cosmic-Frequency: How to get tissue-specific mutated sample frequency with data from COSMIC.  
Microarray-Merging: How to do the merging of multiple GEO microarray datasets.

The tutorials are also published in my [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Karksus).
